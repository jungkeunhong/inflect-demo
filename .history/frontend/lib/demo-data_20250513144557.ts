Detect Agent\nSpots silent churn—users who stop using, but don’t cancel yet. Flags them before it’s too late.\n\n3.	Plan Agent\nAuto-generates win-back flows: free trials, reactivation emails, or Slack alerts—customized by segment.\n\n4.	Act Agent\nExecutes across channels. Sends offers via email, notifies CSMs in Slack, or triggers Retool dashboards.\n\nShall we proceed?",
